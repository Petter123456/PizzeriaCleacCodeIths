### Design Patterns 
1. Singelton for menu: Since there will only be one menu
2. Observer for calculating price, since it is separate from handling the order. 
3. Factory for orders: In order to inject it and use it in the ordersController. 


###FYI
1. Please excuse the horrible tests, I had very litte time to sort them out due to personal reasons.
2. If I had more time i would implement automapper, and do this differently. This is as good as it gets, right now.
